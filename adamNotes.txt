CRC error checking
Sequence number to ensure packets are delivered in order: 4 byte integer, don't deal with wraparound
- don't send any file bigger than 2^32 packets.
Send ACK after getting a packet

Not allowed to send 1 packet, wait for ack, then send next packet.  This is too easy.
Don't send all packets of a file at once either.
Should take the "sliding window" strategy.
- assume all packets of equal length

1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10
take a window size of 5 --> packets 1-5 are in the window
Any packet that is in the sender's window the sender will send out onto the network.
Once a packet is received, the receiver sends an ACK and then moves the window forward by one.
The sender moves his window forward when he gets an ACK for the first packet in the window.
- unload packet from memory
- move window forward one packet (read next packet into first packet's memory)
If the next packet that the receiver sees is (N + 1) not at the start of the window, the window does not move.
- however he does send an ACK
- sender does not move up his window because he still has not received an ACK for packet N
After a certain amount of time, resend a packet that was not ACKed but has already been sent.

If we get duplicate packets:
- received a packet N, and the ACK sent by the receiver for packet N is lost, packet N will be resent by the sender
--> this packet will be received outside of the sliding window

Network simulator: Mininet
ls /lab/networking/Mininet/
--> copy all the files in the directory
--> download the same virtual machine from mininet.org for our own use
--> use in Virtualbox
--> vmplayer path/to/file
-->
    mininet-vm tty1
    login: mininet
    password: mininet

--> 2 hosts, h1 and h2
--> 1 switch, s1
    Network topology: h1 -- s1 -- h2
--> controller 0
    - concept unique to software-defined networking
    - popular in last 2/3 years
    - will talk about later in the semester
h1 and h2 share the same filesystem, so save files with different names or directories than where they were sent from.
Can run wireshark on the hosts.  Just click OK on the error dialog that pops up.
Don't run wireshark on the main terminal of the simulator.  Just run it on the virtual hosts and/or switch.
